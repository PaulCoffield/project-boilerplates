# Project Boilerplates

A collection of boilerplate files to just get started with new projects.

## Making the transition easier

As someone that is always learning different tools & techniques, I have often myself using courses that provide online editors.

Using these tools allow you to skip all the essential setup 'stuff' and just get stuck in to the subject matter itself.

I decided to start creating these boilerplate projects as a way to make it easier to move from online editor to a local code editor.

### Growing with me

As my learning and personal projects grow and incorporate new tools that require extra setup - I will add a new folder to act a base for that particular approach.

That lets me continue to come back and tinker with these setups as my knowledge of them grows - stumbling across the [Frontend Checklist](https://frontendchecklist.io/) is likely to have an impact on this! ü§ì

### #LearningInPublic

I'm steadily making my development work more visible by doing my best to learn in public.

It's a journey that lots of people take, and it's one that's often filled with overwhelming amounts of information - I hope I can help you and others cut through that and just get things done! üí™üèΩ
